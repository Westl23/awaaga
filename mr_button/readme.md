# An interesting button

We made a a sequence of flahing LEDs reset after it meets two conditions: 
the pin (labeled LED) becoming less than 9 and
the button being pressed.

Once the two conditions are met, the LED would then return to its beginning pin number (13) and continue its flashing sequence (until the two conditions are met again).

The code for it is also in this file along with a picture of the setup for the Arduino & breadboard.
